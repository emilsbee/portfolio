## Portoflio website

The website includes all the necessary links, such as to LinkedIn, and also includes my resume. Furthermore, it displays list of my projects with a short description and links to the various techonologies used to develop the project. Although the project repository README is more descriptive and includes much more information, this portfolio website is a compilation of all things related to my journey as a developer.
